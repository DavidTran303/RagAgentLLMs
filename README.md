# RagAgentLLMs
In this project I will create a RAG Agent.
Retrieval Augmented Genration (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language mdoel.
It can retrieve a large amount of data, and trained on vast volumes of data. 
It cna perform questions, translating languages, and completing sentences.
